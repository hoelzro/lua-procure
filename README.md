lua-require - A Pure Lua Implementation of require()
====================================================

*NOTE*: I intend to change this name very soon; I wanted to get some code down
first, so I haven't had to chance to think of a good one.  Suggestions welcome!

This library is a pure Lua implementation of `require()`.  It exists as a reference
for people experienced in Lua but not C and would like a code-based way of looking
at how require() hows.  However, that isn't the only purpose of this library; I intend
to deliver more advanced features on top of the basic `require()` functionality.
